= The Model API

One of the core features and maybe the most important concept of Dolphin Platform is the model synchronization between
client and server. For each view in the client a controller instance "lives" in the server that defines all the logic of
the view. A model is automatically shared and synchronized between the client view and the controller on the server.

.Synchronization of the model

Such a model can be a bean or a hierarchy of several beans. Dolphin Platform provides an API to create full observable
beans for the model layer.

== Creating a bean

A model for the Dolphin Platform can simply be defined as a Java bean but instead of using primitive date types for all
the attributes of the bean Dolphin Platform provides the `Property<V>` interface that should be used to define
attributes. Based on this a definition for a bean with only one String attribute will look like this:

[source,java]
----
@DolphinBean
public class MyModel {

    private Property<String> value;
    
    public Property<String> valueProperty() {
        return value;
    }
    
    public String getValue() {
        return value.get();
    }
   
    public void setValue(String value) {
           this.value.set(value);
    }

}
----

NOTE: Maybe you ask yourself why the `@DolphinBean` annotation is needed. Internally the Dolphin Platform checks if a bean
class is annotated with `@DolphinBean` and will trow a `BeanDefinitionException` if the annotation is not present. By
doing so it will be easy to check if you use the right model classes. We plan to add some additional features based on
the annotation in the future. One example can be an annotation processor that checks if all classes that are defined as
the Dolphin Platform beans (by adding the `@DolphinBean` annotation) are valid Dolphin Platform beans.

[[supported-types]]
== Supported types

Currently Dolphin Platform properties and collections support the following types as content:

* `Integer`
* `Long`
* `Float`
* `Double`
* `Byte`
* `Short`
* `Boolean`
* `String`
* `Date` _(since version 0.8.4)_
* `Calendar` _(since version 0.8.4)_
* `Enums` _(since version 0.8.4)_
* Dolphin Platform Bean <<bean-hierarchies, (see description)>>

CAUTION: As some browsers have issues with Timezone, one has to use UTC. If the provided Calendar is not set to UTC, it
will be converted.

Since version 0.8.8 the Dolphin Platform contains the optional module `dolphin-platform-date-time-converter` that provides
the support for addition types for properties and collections. All the types are part of the Java 8 date and time API:

* Duration
* LocalDateTime
* Period
* ZonedDateTime


CAUTION: Currently the additional data types are only supported in Java. The support for the JavaScript will be added
in a future version

=== Custom data types

Since version 0.8.8 the Dolphin Platform provides a SPI to add custom data types for properties and collections. To add
support for a new data type a custom converter must be provided. To do so the `com.canoo.dolphin.converter.ConverterFactory`
interface must be implemented and provided for
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/spi.html[Java Service Provider Interface (SPI)]. Examples for custom
data types can be found in the sources of the optional `dolphin-platform-date-time-converter` module.

== Using collections

The first example of a Dolphin Platform bean contained only a String property but most of the time you need more complex
beans. That's why we added collection support to the Dolphin Platform model API. Next to the properties a bean can contain
lists that are define by the `ObservableList<V>` interface. The interface extends the default Java `List` interface by adding
support for observers. A Dolphin Platform bean that contains a list might look like this:

[source,java]
----
@DolphinBean
public class MyModel {

    private ObservableList<String> values;

    public ObservableList<String> getValues() {
        return values;
    }

}
----

A `ObservableList<V>` supports <<supported-types, all the same generic types as a property.>>

== Defining the model of a MVC group

As you can see in the following image each MVC group in the Dolphin Platform contains a model. A MVC group is based on the
MVC pattern and contains a controller, a view and a model. In the Dolphin Platform approach the controller lives on the server
and the view is defined on the client. The model is shared between the client and the server.

.A MVC group
image::model-sync.png[]

As we have seen until now a model is defined by properties and collections. Since `Property<V>` and `ObservableList<V>` are
defined as interfaces and no model provides a specific constructor it's still not clear how a new instance of a model should
created. Thanks to the Dolphin Platform architecture a developer don't need to think about the model instanciation or the
lifecycle of a model. Whenever a new MVC group is created by the platform the model instance will be created automatically.
To do so the model must be defined in the controller. The Dolphin Platform provides the `@DolphinModel` annotation that is
used to inject the created model instance in the controller instance. The following sample code shows a minimal controller
that defines its model type:

----
@DolphinController
public class MyController {

    @DolphinModel
    private MyModel model;

}
----

The model instance will be automatically synchronized with the client. Since the model is completelly observable you can
 simply bind the properties and lists that are defined in the model to your UI components in the client.

== Working with the BeanManager

TODO

=== Creating new model instances

Since all beans of the Dolphin Platform model layer will be synchronized between client and server a new model instance
can not be created "by hand" (`MyBean bean = new MyBean`). So instead of creating a new bean instance by calling its
constructor the BeanManager interface must be used to create a new bean instance. By doing so the bean instance will
automatically be added to the bean manager and synchronized between client and server. Here is an example how a bean
instance can be created:

----
MyBean bean = beanManager.create(MyBean.class);
----

=== Removing a bean

The BeanManager interface provides several methods to remove beans. Until a bean is removed by the bean manager it will
be synchronized between client and server. Even if a bean isn't referenced in the custom application code anymore it won't
be removed by the Java Garbage Collection since it's still referenced by the bean manager. The following methods can be
used to remove beans from the client-server-synchronization:

* `void remove(Object bean)`
* `void removeAll(Class<?> beanClass)`
* `void removeAll(Object... beans)`
* `void removeAll(Collection<?> beans)`

All this methods do not work transitive. This means that in a hierarchy of beans all beans must be detached from the
bean manager seperately.

In addition the BeanManager interface provides a method to check if a bean is still synchronized between client and
server or if it's already removed from the bean manager:

* `boolean isManaged(Object bean)`

CAUTION: Currently all mentioned methods are deprecated. Since the Dolphin Platform provides its own Garbage
Collector beans can be automatically removed by the bean manager once they are not referenced in the model layer anymore.
Until now the Dolphin Platform garbage collection is an experimental feature that must be activated on the server. Once
the garbage collection will become a default in the Dolphin Platform the deprecated methods will be removed in a future
release.

== The Dolphin Platform garbage collection

The Dolphin Platform contains a garbage collection on the server that will automatically remove all bean instances from
the remoting layer that aren't referenced anymore by other beans. Currently the garbage collection is an experimental
feature and it's not active by default. If you want to use the garbage collection you need to add
`garbageCollectionActive=true` to the `dolphin.properties` file (see chapter *Server configuration*).

== How to work with the Model API

To get a better overview of the API that helps you to define presentation models in Dolphin Platform we added a small
example.
Let's say we have the following view that can be part of a photo library app:

.Example Application
image::model-example-1.png[]

In this view, we have several elements that need a data model. If the data of this app is stored on a server the data
model must be shared between the client and the server. When having a look at the screen we can see 3 different elements
that need data from the data model to visualize itself or provide user interaction:

* The title of the screen needs a String as its content. We can display the title of a photo album or an internationalized
string.
* The slider that defines a value. Let's imagine that the interaction with the slider changes the size of the pictures in
the main area. Maybe the last value of the slider should be stored on the server to automatically save user preferences
* All pictures in the main area. As you can see each card in this area contains an image and maybe a badge in the top
right corner. A badge element in the top right corner visualizes if the photo is flagged.

Based on this definition we would create a presentation model that might look like this one:

.The presentation model
image::model-example-2.png[]

When defining such a model in JavaFX, you can use the cool property API and the observable collections that are part of
JavaFX. Modern JavaScript frameworks like AngularJS or Polymer provide a similar behavior and therefore we decided to
offer the same benefits when defining models with the Dolphin Platform. In Dolphin Platform you work with properties and
observable collections, too. Therefore it really easy to define a hierarchical model for your view. A model for the
shown view might look like this:

[source,java]
----
@DolphinBean
public class PhotoOverviewModel {

  private Property<String> title;

  private Property<Double> sliderValue;

  private ObservableList<PhotoModel> photos;

  //getter & setter

}

@DolphinBean
public class PhotoModel {

  private Property<String> imageUrl;

  private Property<Boolean> flagged;

  //getter & setter

}
----

All properties and collections in the Dolphin Platform are observable and therefore it's quite easy to observe them on
the client and the server:

[source,java]
----
myModel.getTitleProperty().onChange(e -> System.out.println("New title: " + e.getNewValue()));
----

For all client APIs we support first class support for the Dolphin Platform properties. When working with JavaFX for
example it's quite easy and intuitive to bind a synchronized Dolphin Platform property to a JavaFX property:

[source,java]
----
FXBinder.bind(booleanJavaFXProperty).bidirectionalTo(booleanDolphinProperty);
----

On JavaScript clients the handling is even more elegant as you can bind the Dolphin Platform model directly in HTML.

The main benefit of this concept is that you can use the same model classes on the server and the client. Because the
model will automatically be synchronized between the view and the server controller it feels like you work with the same
instance. By doing so you can simply bind a string property to a textfield in the view and observe it's value on the
server. The change events will automatically be fired on the server when you start typing in the textfield.

== Property Binding

The Dolphin Platform provides an easy way to create a bidirectinal binding between 2 properties of the same generic type.
Currently the binding API only supports properties that are defined in the same client session. If you want to sync
properties on several clients the event bus is currently the best way to do this.
To create a binding between 2 properties in the same client session you need the `PropertyBinder` class. An instance of
this class can simply be injected in any controller:

[source,java]
----
@DolphinController
public class MyController {

    @Inject
    private PropertyBinder binder;

}
----

All binding are definied by qualifiers that are representated by the `Qualifier` class. For a new binding you need to
define a `Qualifier` instance that defines the generic type of the properties that should be bound. Since you can reuse
the `Qualifier` instance for all bindings of that type it's best practice to create a static instance:

[source,java]
----
public interface MyConstants {

    public final static Qualifier<String> userNameQualifier = Qualifier<String>.create();

}
----

Once you have the `PropertyBinder` instance and the `Qualifier` you can defining bindings. To do so you define the same
qualifier for all properties that should be bound:

[source,java]
----
propertyBinder.bind(model.userNameProperty(), MyConstants.userNameQualifier);
----

By using the same qualifier in several controller classes you can simply bind properties in a client scope without doing
manual updates.
