= Changelog

The following overview contains all changes of the Dolphin Platform since version 0.8.0.`

CAUTION: Until version 1.0.0 we will not mark breaking changes in the public API seperately since the API might still change. To
be true most of the public API of the Dolphin Platform is stable since 0.8.5 and the most changes are related to changing
