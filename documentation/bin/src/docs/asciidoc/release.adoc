= Dolphin Platform release documentation
The sources of the Dolphin Platform are seperated in several repositories:

* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform[GitHub repository of the Java API]
* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-js[GitHub repository of the JavaScript basic client API]
* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-polymer[GitHub repository of the Polymer client API]

In addition we provide several repositories that contain jumpstarts for the Dolphin Platform. This repositories
should be released with each release of the Dolphin Platform:

* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-lazybones-templates[Dolphin Platform Lazybones template for a Spring
based jumpstart]
* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-spring-boot-archetype[Dolphin Platform Maven archetype for a Spring
based jumpstart]
* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-kumuluz-archetype[Dolphin Platform Maven archetype for a JavaEE
based jumpstart]

Based on this seperation a release for the Dolphin Platform is more complex than a release for a framework that is based
on one single repository.

There are 2 different release types for the Dolphin Platform:
* The regular (major) release introduces new features and / or bugfixes. We currently try to create such a release in a
periode of 2 weeks. This release will be created from the master branches of all repositories.
* A bugfix (minor) release provides a critical bugfix and will be created based on a regular /major Dolphin Platform
release. This release will normally be based on the release branch of the major release.

To manage releases and the containing issues we use waffle.io as kanban board. You can find it
https://waffle.io/canoo/dolphin-platform[here]

== Install needed tools for the release
TODO: some tools must be installed on the local machine. Add overview for all tools

== Major Release of the Dolphin Platform

This chapter describes how a new major release for the Dolphin Platform can be created.

When doing a major release of the Dolphin Platform the first or second number in the version number should be updates.
Based on this the next major release after `0.9.0` will be `0.10.0` and after `1.2.0` the next release will be `1.3.0`.

For a release the repositories shoud be released in a defined order to create a accurate release. The following
documentation shows a step by step instruction to release all repositories. In general a release starts by releasing
the sources of the JavaScript API repositores followed by the Java repository. Once this is done the jumpstart related
repositories can be released in any order.

==== Releasing the JavaScript repositories
A developer should always start to release the *JavaScript basic API*. To do so several steps are needed:

* The https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-js[JavaScript basic API repository] must be check out on the local
machine
* Create a new branch `release/VERSION` where `VERSION` defines the version that should be released (like `release/0.10.x`)
* Check out the created release branch
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `npm install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the npm dependencies
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `bower install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the bower dependencies
* In the root folder of the project the `npm update` command must be called to update all npm dependencies
* In the root folder of the project the `bower update` command must be called to update all bower dependencies
* As a next step the project must be build by using gulp. To do so call `gulp clean verify build` in the root
folder of the project
* If the build executes without any error the new version number for the release must be specified in the following
files: `bower.json`, `package.json`, `sonar-project.properties`
* Once this is done the current state must be tagged in git. The name of the tag must match the version of the new
release like `0.10.0`
* Once the tag is uploaded to the global repository at GitHub the JavaScript basic API has been released

As a next step the *Poylmer API* can be released. To do so several steps are needed:

* The https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-polymer[Polymer API repository] must be check out on the local
machine
* Check out the master branch
* The dependency of the Dolphin Platform JS client must be set to the new version in the `bower.json` file
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `npm install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the npm dependencies
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `bower install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the bower dependencies
* In the root folder of the project the `npm update` command must be called to update all npm dependencies
* In the root folder of the project the `bower update` command must be called to update all bower dependencies
* The new version number for the release must be specified in the following
files: `bower.json`, `package.json` and `sonar-project.properties`
* As a next step the project must be build by using gulp. To do so call `gulp clean verify build` in the root
folder of the project.
* If the build is running commit all changes to master
* Create a new branch `release/VERSION` where `VERSION` defines the version that should be released (like `release/0.10.x`)
* Check out the created release branch
* Once this is done the current state must be tagged in git. The name of the tag must match the version of the new
release like `0.10.0`
* Once the tag is uploaded to the global repository at GitHub the Polymer basic API has been released

As a next step the *AngularJS API* can be released. To do so several steps are needed:

* The https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-angularjs[AngularJS API repository] must be check out on the local
machine
* Check out the master branch
* The dependency of the Dolphin Platform JS client must be set to the new version in the `bower.json` file
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `npm install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the npm dependencies
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `bower install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the bower dependencies
* In the root folder of the project the `npm update` command must be called to update all npm dependencies

folder of the project.
* If the build is running commit all changes to master
* Create a new branch `release/VERSION` where `VERSION` defines the version that should be released (like `release/0.10.x`)
* Check out the created release branch
* Once this is done the current state must be tagged in git. The name of the tag must match the version of the new
release like `0.10.0`
* Once the tag is uploaded to the global repository at GitHub the AngularJS basic API has been released


==== Releasing the Java repository
* update the dependencies of all JavaScript modules in the `platform-examples` folder to the new version
* Try all examples
* check the changelog for current release in the documentation if all changes are mentioned
* Commit the changes to master

must be configured in the gradle.properties file (`/userHome/.gradle/gradle.properties`). Add the properties `bintrayUsername` and `bintrayApiKey` to the file.
* Create a tag from the release branch. The name of the tag must match the version of the new
release like `0.10.0`
* Upload the tag is to the global repository at GitHub
* If this release changed the first number in the version number (like 1.X.X -> 2.X.X) we need to update the SNAPSHOT version in the master

release like `0.10.0`
* Upload the tag is to the global repository at GitHub
* Login to Bintray and publish all artifacts to JCenter and Maven Central

==== General release steps

* Next to the release of the software the version numbers of the latest stable should be updated in tutorials and
readme.md files of the repos.

released version and copy the changelog for the new version in it
* The milestone in github must be closed (see https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform/milestones[milestones])

== Minor Release of the Dolphin Platform

This chapter describes how a new minor release for the Dolphin Platform can be created.

When doing a major release of the Dolphin Platform the third number in the version number should be updates.
